# -Serverless-API-using---AWS
 Serverless API using - AWS

 In this project, I have created an API using AWS services that is scalable and accessible from anywhere. Initially, I developed an AWS Lambda function and tested it within Lambda. Subsequently, I integrated this lambda function with Amazon API Gateway and further tested it using Postman.
